Open up the terminal. Type the following code. 
```
 a = []
 print(len(a))
 a.append('First Item')
 print(a)
 
```
What was the length of `[]`?
<br>
<br>
<br>

What does append do? What would the length be after append? 
<br>
<br>
<br>


Brainstorm how you would print the first element from `a_list`?
<br>
<br>
<br>

Type the following into the terminal. What happens? 
```
 a_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
 print(a_list[0])
 print(a_list[1])
 print(a_list[2])
 print(a_list[3])
 print(a_list[4])
 print(a_list[5])
 print(a_list[6])
```

What type do you think the following is? 
```
unknown = ['a', 'b', 11, ['look', 'wow', 'cool']]
```

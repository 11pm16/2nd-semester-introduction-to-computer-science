# Do Now 2.06

## Part 1

Open up the console. Type the following code using interactive mode:

```text
 >>> a = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
 >>> b = a[0:2]
 >>> print(a)
 >>> print(b)
```

What happens to a? What is b? What type is b?   
   
   


```text
 >>> a = [123, 'First Item', 456]
 >>> a.remove('First Item')
 >>> print(a)
```

What does `remove` do? What would the length of this list be after `remove`?   
   
   


```text
 >>> a = [123, 'First Item', 456]
 >>> a.pop()
 >>> print(a)
```

What does `pop` do? What is the difference between `remove` and `pop`?   
   
   


```text
 >>> a = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
 >>> b = a + ['Third Item']
 >>> print(a)
 >>> print(b)
```

What happens to a? What is b? What type is b?   
   
   


```text
 >>> a = []
 >>> print(len(a))
 >>> a.append('First Item')
 >>> print(a)
```

What was the length of `[]`?   
   
   


What does `append` do? What would the length be after `append`?

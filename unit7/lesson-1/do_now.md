# Do Now 7.02

1. Type and run the following code: 

```python
class Pet(object): 
    def __init__(self, name): 
        self.name = name

my_pet = Pet("Peter")
print(my_pet.name)
```

What is the purpose of the `__init__` method?

  
  
 What if you wanted to initialize all pet objects with a name and a color? How would you modify the code to create a pet object with a name of "Peter" and a color of "brown"?

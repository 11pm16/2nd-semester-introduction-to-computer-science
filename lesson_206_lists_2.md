# Lesson 2.06: Lists 2

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: slice, append, remove, nested list
* Slice a list
* Add and remove elements from a list
* Access items from a nested list

##Materials/Preperation
* [Do Now Handout]
* [Lab]
* Read through the handout, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Note
1. Lesson
  1. Ask students what doing `a[0:2]` did? 
    1. slicing: a list operation that gives back a list starting from the index to the left of the colon and going up to the index to the right of the colon. 
    2. Ask what the list would return if you did `a[1:2]`? 
  2. Ask students what the plus sign does? What does append do? 
  2. Break for students to practice creating lists. Ask them how they would get the last item in a list. (Hint use the length function!) 
  3. Ask students to write on the board how they got the last element of a list. Ask another student to write how they would get the second to last element of the list and so on. 
  4. After accessing this element you can change it. Practice this in class. 
2. Lab
    1. Practice accessing and updating items in a list
    2. Implement program from last lab using lists
    3. Create a quiz program
3. Opportunities for more
    1. If students are moving quickly, start topic of nested lists. Start of with a simple nested list like `['a', 'b', 'c', [1, 2, 3]]`. Ask the students to guess the length. Ask the students to guess how they would access the item '1' from that list!

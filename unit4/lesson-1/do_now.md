## Do Now 4.02

## Part 1

Copy and run the following code into the interpreter.

```python
for i in range(0, 10): 
    print(i)
```

Write down what the range function does.

## Part 2

Use the `range` and `len` functions to make a for loop that loops through `a`.

```python
a = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'grapes']
```

len\_a = len\(a\)  
range\(0, len\(a\)\)

Write down what `range(0, len(a))` does.  
  
 What is the return value of the range function?  
  
  
  


## Part 3

Use the `range` and `len` functions to make a for loop. \(Remember that for loops iterate over lists\)

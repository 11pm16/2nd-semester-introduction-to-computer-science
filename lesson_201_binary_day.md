## Instructor's Note
1. Lesson
  1. Ask students how they counted to 10
  2. Ask students how they counted to 1023? 
    1. Assign each finger to be a number place? [worksheet](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/binary-count-fingers.html)
    2. If this is confusing can try the index card binary. 
  2. Discuss how everything the computer reads gets turned into binary in the end. 
    1. How could letters be turned into binary? How can letters be turned into numbers? a = 1, b = 2, c = 3. 
  4. More fun binary ideas? 
2. Lab
    1. Practice predicting what casting will do to inputs. 
    2. Create a halving program as well as program that halves to whole numbers. 
3. Opportunities for more
    1. If students are moving quickly, it is possible to introduce the concepts of booleans here. Discuss how students would represent binary (0s and 1s). In practice these translate to True and False. Convert numbers to boolean, and booleans to number.

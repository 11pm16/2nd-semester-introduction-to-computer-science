# Lesson 2.05: Lists

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: list, item, index, integer
* Be able to access items from a list using index
* Create lists of different types
* Use the length function

##Materials/Preperation
* [Do Now Handout]
* [Lab]
* Read through the handout, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Note
1. Lesson
  1. Ask students what a list is? 
    1. a list is a sequence of values. In a list, they can be any type. The values in a list are called elements or sometimes items.
    2. to create a list enclose items in square brackets
    3. Ask students what values items in a list can be? Answer any type! You can even have lists within lists (more on that later...)
  2. Ask students what len does? 
  3. Ask students how they tried to print the first item from a list? Was this what they were expecting? 
    1. 
  2. Ask students what they thought having str('12') did? Define this as casting. 
  3. Ask students what they did to cast an integer into a string? Define the int function if the students were unable to guess it from the lab.
  4. Break for a few minutes to have students write down how they would produce the following program using the input function:
    ```
    > 
    Give me a number you want to multiply by 2: 4
    8
    => None
    ```
  5. Have students write their answers on the board. Discuss what would happen if you put in 1.5 instead of 4? If input is a float, can cast with float(num)
2. Lab
    1. Practice predicting what casting will do to inputs. 
    2. Create a halving program as well as program that halves to whole numbers. 
3. Opportunities for more
    1. If students are moving quickly, it is possible to introduce the concepts of booleans here. Discuss how students would represent binary (0s and 1s). In practice these translate to True and False. Convert numbers to boolean, and booleans to number.

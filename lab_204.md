# Lab 2.04

1) Without using the computer, predict what will be happen in the following program. 

*  
*  ```
    a = 100
    difficulty_level= 7
    if a > 85 and b > 7:
        print("Stellar Grade")
    elif a <= 85 and b <= 7: 
        print("okay grade")
    else: 
        print("pretty good grade") ```
<br>

*  
*  ```
    a = input("What... is your quest") 
    b = "to seek the holy grail"
    if a != b: 
        print("Go On. Off you go") 
    else: 
        b = input("What...is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?")
<br>

*  
*  ```
    >>> a = 100
    >>> b = "science"
    >>> a > 75 or b != "science" ```
<br>

*  
*  ```
    >>> a = 100
    >>> b = "science"
    >>> c = True
    >>> not c and a > 75 and b == science ```
<br>


2) Create a "Can I president program", which determines if user could be president. Use user input. The rules for being president of the US are: 
    1. Older than 35
    2. Resident of US for 14 Years
    3. Natural born citizen
Print `True` if the person could be president and `False` if they can't be president. 

3) Alter one line of that program to be a "I can't be president?" game. Print `True` if the user cannot be president and `False` if they can be president

4)Create a program "Can I ride the roller coaster". A roller coaster has the rule that a rider has to be over the height of 50 inches. Because of a legal loophole, if you are over the age of 18 you can ride regardless of your height. If you are allowed to ride, the coaster costs 4 quarters (although the operator accepts tips so more money is appreciated). The theme park sells frequent rider passes, with a frequent rider pass the roller coaster costs 2 quarters. Ask the user how tall they are in inches, their age, how many quarters they have, and if they have a frequent pass. Print `True` if the person can ride and `False` if they can't. 


Extra Credit: Are the following equivalent. Research DeMorgan's Laws and write why you think they are the same or why they are not the same. 
`not(x or y) == not x and not y`
`not(x and y) == not x or not y`

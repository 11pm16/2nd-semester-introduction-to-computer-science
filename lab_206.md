1. Predict what will be printed. Then run the program and confirm. 
    *  
    *  ```
        a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
        print(a[0:3])
        print(a[1:4])```
    <br>
    *  
    *  ```
        a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
        print(a[1:len(a) - 3])```
    <br>
    
    *  
    *  ```
        a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
        b = a.remove('b')
        print(a)
        print(b)```
    <br>
    
    *  
    *  ```
        a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
        a[0] = 'haha'
        b = a.pop()
        print(a)
        print(b)```
    <br> 
    
    *  
    *  ```
        a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
        b = a + ['abc']
        print(a)
        print(b)```
    <br>     
    
    *  
    *  ```
        a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
        b = a.append('f')
        print(a)
        print(b)```

2. Remember the tic-tac-toe board we created in class? Create game play for tic-tac-toe 
    * Create a game with 9 moves. 
    * Have a variable keep track of who's won
    * User picks a location on the board according to the number:

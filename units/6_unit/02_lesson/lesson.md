## Instructor's Notes

1. **Do Now**
    * Display the Do Now on the board.
    * Students type code that edits dictionaries by modifying, adding, or removing key:value pairs.
2. **Lesson**
	* Discuss part 1 of the Do Now.
		* Describe that you can update a value in a dictionary in a similar way to how you would update a value in a list.
	* Discuss part 2 of the Do Now.
		* Note that you can add values to a dictionary by using the same syntax.
		* Review: How might you check if a value was in a dictionary before adding it? 
	* Discuss part 3 of the Do Now 
		* Review what **pop** does, as well as what the second argument does.
			* The second argument in `pop` is described as the **default value**. This is the value that will be returned if the first argument is not in the dictionary. 
3. **Lab**	
	* Students will create a word count algorithm that will count the number of words in a list of words. 
4. **Debrief**
	* Talk about any confusion the students had. Discuss additional ideas of how dictionaries might be useful. 

###Accommodation/Differentiation
Some students may need to be explicitly reminded of the `in` keyword to check if a certain key is in their dictionary.

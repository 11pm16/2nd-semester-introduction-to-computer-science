	    * Go over it in detail, including the user experience, data structures, milestones, and grading.
	1. **Walk through start project**
	   * Have the students import and run the starter project in their IDE (may involve cut-and-pasting the files).
	   * Point out the several places where the project announces that functions have not yet been fully implemented.
	   * Orient the students to the contents of the several files.
	   * Review the tables in the Project spec that list which functions students must implement.

### Accommodation/Differentiation
Some students may need help a refresher on using arguments to avoid creating global variables.

Some students may also need additional assistance in handling the header line of the inventory file differently from all the non-header lines.

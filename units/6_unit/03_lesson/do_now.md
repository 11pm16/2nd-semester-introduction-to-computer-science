1. Type and run the following code in the interpreter: 

    ```python
weekend_dates = {
  'April 2018': [7, 8, 14, 15, 21, 22, 28, 29],
  'May 2018': [5, 6, 12, 13, 19, 20, 26, 27]
}

print(weekend_dates['April 2018'])
    ```
Write down what type `weekend_dates` is, what type the keys are, and what type the values are. <br><br><br>

2. The Memorial Day holiday is observed on May 28, which makes it a
   long weekend. Write code so that the value of 'May 2018' becomes
   `[5, 6, 12, 13, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28]`

1. Type and run the following code: 

    ```python
my_dictionary = {
    'cat': 'a domestic feline', 
    'dog': 'a domestic canine', 
    'chair': 'furniture piece for sitting', 
    'car': 'automobile'
    }
print(my_dictionary)
print(my_dictionary['dog'])
print(my_dictionary.get('dog'))
print('cat' in my_dictionary)
print('monkey' in my_dictionary)
    ```
Write down what was printed out. What type is `my_dictionary`? 
<br><br><br>

2. Add a line of code that will print the definition of `'chair'`, then run the code again.<br><br><br>

3. Write down what happens if you use `my_dictionary['kittens']`? What do you think that error means?

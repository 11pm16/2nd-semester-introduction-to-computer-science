#Lesson 5.04: EarSketch User-Defined Functions

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **abstraction**, **section**, **A-B-A form**
* Create and apply user-defined functions to create songs with complicated form


##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab]
* Associated Reading in EarSketch
*  Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Notes

1. **Do Now**
    * Students should be given time to read unit 4 of the EarSketch documentation.
    * Students are expected to write down key terms as they read.
2. **Lesson**
	* Ask what terminology and concepts the students wrote down or remembered from the reading. 
		* **Section**: generally refers to several measures of music (often 2, 4, 8, or 16 measures) that sound like a single musical unit.
		* **A-B-A Form**: a song divided into three sections:
			* Section A: measures 1-4.
			* Section B: measures 5-7. Features contrasting sounds to Section A.
			* Section A (repeated): measures 7-10.
	* Ask students about returning the measure number. Go over the concept of passing around the measure number and make sure students understand how it would be helpful. (Since it allows you to change how long/short sections are without updating every function)
3. **Lab**	
	* Demo a song with **A-B-A Form**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU)
	* Students create their own song with the form ABABAB. 
4. **Debrief**
	* Talk about any of the phrases or issues the students had. Did they find it easy to understand the code when they read it.

###Accommodation/Differentiation
Students that are moving quickly could explore and create alternative song forms (ex. AABA).

# Lab 3.01

1) Practice importing random, use `randint` with different arguments. Simulate a coin flip. Simulate a dice roll.

2) Look on the documentation of the random library. Find another function that returns a value. 

3) Create a program that simulates a magic 8 ball. Store all the responses in a list. When the program is run, return a random response. 
Response examples: 

* outlook is good
* ask again later
* yes
* no
* most likely no
* most likely yes
* maybe
* outlook is not good

Extra Credit: Research the math library and create a program that finds the length of a triangle given two sides

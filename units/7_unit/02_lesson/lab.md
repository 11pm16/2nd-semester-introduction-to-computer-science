# Lab 7.02 - Pet Class

In this lab we will create a Pet class that will keep track of the type of animal, color, food, noise and name of a given animal.

1. Create a class called Pet that has the following attributes: 
	* Type (i.e. dog, cat, fish)
	* Color (i.e. spotted, black, tabby, white)
	* Food (i.e. kibbles, tuna, fish flakes)
	* Noise (i.e. meow, woof, bark)
	* Name (i.e. Sparky, Scooby Doo)
2. Make sure to use the `__init__` method to create these attributes.
3. Create a list of pets.
4. Create a function that takes in a list of pets and prints out the name and the food attributes.
5. Test your function with your list of pets.

1. Type and run the following code. 
    ```python
    class Time(object): 
	    def __init__(self, hour, minute, second): 
		    self.hour = hour
		    self.minute = minute
		    self.second = second

    time1 = Time(5, 32, 0)
    time2 = Time(23, 11, 11)

    print(time1)
    print(time2)
    ```

2. Based on what is output, how can you tell the difference between `time1` and `time2`? 

3. What happens if you try to add `time1` add `time2`?

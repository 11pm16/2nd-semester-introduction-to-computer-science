# Do Now 4.02

Copy and run the following code into the interpreter. 
```python
for i in range(0, 10): 
	print(i)
```
Write down what the range function does.



Use the `range` and `len` functions to make a for loop that loops through `a`.

```python
a = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'grapes']
```

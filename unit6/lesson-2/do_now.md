# Do Now 6.03

1. Type and run the following code in the interpreter: 

```python
weekend_dates = {
  'April 2018': [7, 8, 14, 15, 21, 22, 28, 29],
  'May 2018': [5, 6, 12, 13, 19, 20, 26, 27]
}

print(weekend_dates['April 2018'])
```

Write down what type `weekend_dates` is, what type the keys are, and what type the values are.   
  
  


1. The 2018 Memorial Day holiday is observed on Monday, May 28, which makes it a

   long-weekend day. Write a new line of code that adds May 28th to

   the list associated with

   `'May 2018'`, so that its value becomes

   `[5, 6, 12, 13, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28]`.

# Lab 2.03

1) Without using the computer, predict if the following will be `True` or `False`. Check your answers in interactive mode. 

*  
*  ```
    > a = 100
    > b = "science"
    > a > 75 and b == "science" ```
<br>

*  
*  ```
    >>> a = 100
    >>> b = "science"
    >>> a > 75 and b != "science" ```
<br>

*  
*  ```
    >>> a = 100
    >>> b = "science"
    >>> a > 75 or b != "science" ```
<br>

*  
*  ```
    >>> a = 100
    >>> b = "science"
    >>> c = True
    >>> not c and a > 75 and b == science ```

2) Create a "Can I president program", which determines if user could be president. Use user input. The rules for being president of the US are: 
    1. Older than 35
    2. Resident of US for 14 Years
    3. Natural born citizen
Print `True` if the person could be president and `False` if they can't be president. 

3) Alter one line of that program to be a "I can't be president?" game. Print `True` if the user cannot be president and `False` if they can be president

4) 

Extra Credit: Make your program have two modes: an integer mode and a float mode. Add another input to ask which mode the user wants to use. If the user is in integer mode print out integers, otherwise print out float. Feel free to research python docs (This is a concept covered in snap)

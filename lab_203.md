1) Without using the computer, predict if the following will be `True` or `False`. Check your answers in interactive mode. 

*  
*  ```
    > a = 100
    > b = "science"
    > a > 75 and b == "science" ```
<br>

*  
*  ```
    >>> a = 100
    >>> b = "science"
    >>> a > 75 and b != "science" ```
<br>

*  
*  ```
    >>> a = 100
    >>> b = "science"
    >>> a > 75 or b != "science" ```
<br>

*  
*  ```
    >>> a = 100
    >>> b = "science"
    >>> c = True
    >>> not c and a > 75 and b == science ```
<br>


2) Create a program, which will take in an input and print out that input divided by 2. 

3) Alter one line of that program to return only whole numbers. 

Extra Credit: Make your program have two modes: an integer mode and a float mode. Add another input to ask which mode the user wants to use. If the user is in integer mode print out integers, otherwise print out float. Feel free to research python docs (This is a concept covered in snap)

# Lesson 2.03: Booleans & Expressions

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: evaluating, expressions, True, False
* Evaluate a boolean expression
* Compose boolean expressions using and, or, not, <, >, == 

##Materials/Preperation
* [Do Now Handout]
* Read through the handout, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Note
1. Have students work on the Do Now part 1
2. Lesson
  1. Ask students what they thought a Boolean was? 
    1. If students are struggling. Ask them what values they saw? (answer should be True or False) 
    2. Boolean expression: is an expression that evaluates to either true or false.
  1. Ask Students about the difference between `=` and `==`. 
    1. = is a setter for variables 
    2. == builds a boolean expression
  2. Show Students boolean expressons in SNAP.

  3. Ask students what they did to cast an integer into a string? Define the int function if the students were unable to guess it from the lab.
  4. Break for a few minutes to have students write down how they would produce the following program using the input function:
    ```
    > 
    Give me a number you want to multiply by 2: 4
    8
    => None
    ```
  5. Have students write their answers on the board. Discuss what would happen if you put in 1.5 instead of 4? If input is a float, can cast with float(num)
3. Lab
    1. Practice predicting what casting will do to inputs. 
    2. Create a halving program as well as program that halves to whole numbers. 
4. Opportunities for more
    1. If students are moving quickly, it is possible to introduce the concepts of booleans here. Discuss how students would represent binary (0s and 1s). In practice these translate to True and False. Convert numbers to boolean, and booleans to number.
